Need to develop a Python-based IoT simulator for a smart 
home automation system. The simulator should emulate the behaviour of various IoT 
devices commonly found in a smart home, such as smart lights, thermostats, and 
security cameras. Also create a central automation system that manages these 
devices and build a monitoring dashboard to visualise and control the smart home. 
This task improve Python programming skills, including OOP, 
data handling, real-time data monitoring, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
